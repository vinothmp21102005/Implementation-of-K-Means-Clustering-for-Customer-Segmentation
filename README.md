# Implementation-of-K-Means-Clustering-for-Customer-Segmentation

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the K Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. import required python files
2. load the data set and check for null values
3. import KMeans from sklearn.cluster and also declare a empty list
4. now use kmeans to form a cluster and append it the empty list
5. plot the graph and predict the values

## Program:
```
/*
Program to implement the K Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation.
Developed by:

*/
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to implement the K Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation is written and verified using python programming.
